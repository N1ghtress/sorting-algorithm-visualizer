# SORTING ALGORITHM VISUALIZER
This project is a sorting algorithm visualizer.
As its name suggests, a bunch of sorting algorithms are implemented and are at user's freedom to test.
The goal is to provide a clean and intuitive UI to the user, for they to visualize the differences in sorting algorithms.

# TODO
- Render "bars" for each value in array
- Animate swaps and comparisons
